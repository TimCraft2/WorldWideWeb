Hello, im Tim, This is some code for my website :] I am going to use netlify to host it but all of the code will be written by me If you want to create your own website but are a noob like me theres some tips i guess i could share since thats what i did. Look at the source behind other websites, that was the main way i found out how to do things, im not super good at it or something but atleast it works.
